# MCCI-Kill-Sound-LMS-Extension

This is a simple chrome extension which determines when a submission button is clicked in Brightspace, Google Classroom, or Canvas Learning Management Systems and plays the "kill" sound effect from popular Minecraft server - Minecraft Championship: Island (MCCI) upon the click of a submission button. This mini project fulfills the request of a few friends to add some positive reinforcement for their respective academic endeavors.
